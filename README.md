# 🐝 Swarm Intelligence - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This project demonstrates **Swarm Intelligence** using a simple **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm implemented in Python.

PSO is a nature-inspired optimization technique where multiple agents (particles) search for the best solution by learning from their own and others' experiences — just like **ants, birds, or bees** in the real world.

## 🚀 Features

- Simple, beginner-friendly Python implementation
- Optimizes a mathematical function (`f(x, y) = x² + y²`)
- Uses multiple particles (agents) acting as a swarm
- Shows how agents cooperate to reach an optimal solution
- Fully commented code for easy learning

## 🧠 What is Swarm Intelligence?

**Swarm Intelligence** is a decentralized, collective behavior seen in nature. It involves many simple agents (like ants, birds, or drones) working together **without any central leader** to solve complex problems.

In this project, each **particle**:
- Starts with a random position
- Remembers its personal best
- Learns from the group's best (global best)
- Moves toward better solutions over time
